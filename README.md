# Vite-Express-Template

**Vite-Express-Template** combines **Vite** for fast front-end development with **Express** for back-end API handling. It provides a full-stack setup where **Vite** manages the front-end development workflow with hot-reloading, while **Express** serves API routes and static files, ensuring a seamless development experience. This template includes **PostgreSQL** for the database and **Knex.js** as the query builder, simplifying database interactions.

The template also includes automated **testing** with:

-   **Jest** and **Supertest** for back-end API route testing.
-   **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for front-end component testing.

Additionally, it offers **Docker compatibility**, allowing for easy containerized deployment and development. Docker ensures a consistent environment for running the application, simplifying dependency management and deployment.

## Knex Migrations & Seeding

### Running Migrations & Seeds

Run `./knex.sh` to apply database migrations and seed data:

```sh
  ./knex.sh
```

This executes the following commands in order:

-   `npx knex migrate:rollback` → Rolls back the last migration batch
-   `npx knex migrate:latest` → Runs all pending migrations
-   `npx knex seed:run` → Populates the database with seed data

### Creating Migrations and Seeds

To generate new migration and seed files, run:

```sh
  ./knex.sh <migration_and_seed_name> [additional_migrations_and_seeds...]
```

For example:

```sh
  ./knex.sh roles users
```

This generates the following migration and seed files:

```sh
migrations/
├── 00_20250320193622_roles.js
├── 01_20250320193622_users.js

seeds/
├── 00_roles.js
├── 01_users.js
```
